            <h2 class="sub-title">Notes:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li id="Notes1">you can use Ai to Generate BoilerPlate Code/Documenation some Examples 
                    that I use are GitHub Copliot in VSCode Because it Reduces Boilerplate However
                    uses Ai to Generate the Core Logic of the Code is not Acceptable. BoilerPlate Mostly
                    Includes Generating Things like Documentation Comments, Basic Class Structures, and
                    Repetitive Code Patterns like Implimenting Algorithims like Sorting Algorithims. and
                    I Already said this but you Must check the Ai Generated Code for Proformance, Robustness,
                    and Correctness.
                </li>
                <li id="Notes2">Exceptions are not allowed because they are not Explicit Error Handling and
                    they can be Missused to Hide Errors and make the Code less Robust. Instead of using
                    Exceptions you should use Result Types or Error Codes to Handle Errors Explicitly. 
                    Addtionally using Exceptions it Cannot be Determined where Errors can be Thrown.
