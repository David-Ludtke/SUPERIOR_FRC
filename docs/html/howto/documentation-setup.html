            <h3 id="css-folder">css folder:</h3>
            <p>
                The css folder is located in the docs directory for ease of use. You will
                not mannually need to fetch file's from here because the helper scripts in
                the js folder do it for you. This file contains all the styling you will
                need to document and should not be touched for that reason.
            </p>
            <h3 id="home-folder">html folder:</h3>
            <p>
                The html folder contains all of the actual documentation and therefore
                is the largest folder in docs. It contains the sub folder's: <b>howto/</b>, 
                <b>sfrc/</b>, and <a href="#"><b>whatis/</b></a>. The howto/ folder is what you are in right
                now it is the place to learn how to document. The sfrc/ folder contains all
                the information on the documentation. The whatis/ folder contains definition's
                on the words namespace, function, and class.
            </p>
