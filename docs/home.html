		<h1>WORK IN PROGRESS. NOTHING IS FINAL</h1>
		<h3>Documentation for SUPERIOR_FRC</h3>
		<h4>Rules:</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Documenation may only be deleted if they are no longer needed.</li>
			<li>we will not use the operators -- or ++ because they result in unpredictable behavior.</li>
			<li>use your own work. do not use other peoples work because that is not only dishonorly but you are also taking away an oportunity for somebody else to solve the problem if they so chose.</li>
			<li>addtionally we do not use ai to generate code or idea's because for the same reason's</li>
			<li>if we chose to use an external library it must be argreed apon by everyone.</li>
			<li>we make robust code. even if the code is 50x more complex than the alternative which is code that can fail.</li>
			<li>help other's if ask for it.</li>
			<li>document everything you make. it makes it 100,000 times easier to use already existing code that somebody already spent time on.</li>
			<li>use factory constructers because it's most robust solution and avoids expensive exceptions and allows you to return a optional value.</li>
			<li>we don't use exceptions but instead the type Optional for robust and fast error handeling </li>
		</ol>
